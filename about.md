SceneJS is an extensible WebGL-based 3D engine for rendering high-detail scenes for applications such as
engineering, medicine and data visualisation.
 <br><br>
Though it's got a nice friendly API, don't let that fool you - internally it's **optimised to death** with things like
scene compilation and GL state sorting. SceneJS is designed to eat long lists of draw calls for breakfast.
